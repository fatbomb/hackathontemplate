# Introduction to Basic Trigonometry

Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, especially right-angled triangles. It is widely used in science, engineering, architecture, and everyday problem-solving.

### Example

If a right triangle has an angle $\theta$, an opposite side of length 3, an adjacent side of length 4, and a hypotenuse of length 5:

- $\sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}$
- $\cos(\theta) = \frac{4}{5}$
- $\tan(\theta) = \frac{3}{4}$

## 4. Reciprocal Trigonometric Ratios

- **Cosecant ($\csc$)**: $\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}$
- **Secant ($\sec$)**: $\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}$
- **Cotangent ($\cot$)**: $\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)}$

## 5. The Unit Circle

The **unit circle** is a circle with a radius of 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate plane. It helps define trigonometric functions for all angles, not just those in right triangles.

- The coordinates $(x, y)$ on the unit circle correspond to $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))$.

## 6. Trigonometric Identities

Identities are equations that are always true for any value of the variable.

- **Pythagorean Identity:**  
    $\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1$
- **Angle Sum and Difference:**  
    $\sin(a \pm b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) \pm \cos(a)\sin(b)$
- **Double Angle Formulas:**  
    $\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)$  
    $\cos(2\theta) = \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta)$

## 7. Applications of Trigonometry

Trigonometry is used to:
- Calculate heights and distances (surveying, navigation)
- Model periodic phenomena (sound, light waves)
- Solve problems in physics and engineering

## 8. Practice Problems

1. In a right triangle, if the angle is 30Â° and the hypotenuse is 10, what is the length of the side opposite the angle?
2. Find $\sin(45^\circ)$, $\cos(45^\circ)$, and $\tan(45^\circ)$.
3. If $\sin(\theta) = 0.6$, what is $\cos(\theta)$ using the Pythagorean identity?
