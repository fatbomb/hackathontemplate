# Notations

Mr Mokbul is hosting a house party with 5 of his friends. They have shaked hands with each other. Someone took note of the handshakes in a very simple diagram such as the one below:

<div className=' align-middle w-1/3'>
    <Image src="/graph.png" width={1920} height={1080} alt="graph"/>
</div>

Each friend is represented by a circle with numbers in them, and the handshakes are represented by lines connecting the circles. This diagram is called a **graph**.

       - A **vertex** (plural: vertices) is a fundamental unit in a graph, representing a point or node where edges meet or connect. Denoted by $V$, $V(G)$ would mean the set of vertices in graph $G$. In the example above, each friend is represented by a vertex.

       - An **edge** is a line or connection between two vertices in a graph. Edges represent the relationships or links between the vertices and can be directed (having a direction) or undirected (no direction). Usually denoted by $E$, $E(G)$ would mean the set of edges in graph $G$. In the example above, each handshake is represented by an edge

       - A **graph** is a collection of vertices and edges. It can be represented as $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. In the example above, the graph consists of 5 vertices (friends) and 10 edges (handshakes).
