# Graphs, Vertices and Edges
<hr />

Mr Mokbul is hosting a house party with 5 of his friends. They have shaked hands with each other. Someone took note of the handshakes in a very simple diagram such as the one below:

<div className=' align-middle w-1/3 p-3'>
    <Image src="/graph.png" width={1920} height={1080} alt="graph"/>
</div>

Each friend is represented by a circle with numbers in them, and the handshakes are represented by lines connecting the circles. This diagram is called a **graph**.

Each circle, representing a friend, is called a **vertex** (plural: vertices). The lines connecting the circles, representing the handshakes, are called **edges**.
