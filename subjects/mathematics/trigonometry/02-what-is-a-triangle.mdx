# What is a Triangle?

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles. In trigonometry, we often focus on **right triangles**, which have one angle equal to 90 degrees.

- **Hypotenuse:** The side opposite the right angle; it is the longest side.
- **Opposite Side:** The side opposite the angle of interest.
- **Adjacent Side:** The side next to the angle of interest (but not the hypotenuse).
