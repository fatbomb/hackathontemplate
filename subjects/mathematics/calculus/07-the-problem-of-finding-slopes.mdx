# The Problem of Finding Slopes

Before the development of calculus, mathematicians could easily find the slope of a straight line, but struggled with curves. The central problem was: **How do you determine the slope of a curve at a single point?** For a straight line, the slope is constant, but for a curve, it changes at every point.

In the 17th century, thinkers like Pierre de Fermat, Isaac Newton, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz explored this challenge. They realized that to find the "instantaneous rate of change" (the slope at a single point), you could look at the slopes of secant lines—lines connecting two points on the curve—and see what happens as the points get infinitely close together.

This idea led to the concept of the **derivative**, which formalizes the process of finding the slope of a curve at any point. The derivative became a foundational tool in calculus, allowing mathematicians and scientists to analyze motion, growth, and change in a precise way.
