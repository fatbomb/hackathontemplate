# Continuity

A function $f(x)$ is **continuous** at a point $x = a$ if the following three conditions are satisfied:

1. $f(a)$ is defined.
2. $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists.
3. $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$.

In other words, the value of the function at $a$ matches the limit of the function as $x$ approaches $a$.
