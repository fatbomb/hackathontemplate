# Types of Limits

### One-Sided Limits

One-sided limits consider the behavior of a function as it approaches a certain value from one side (left or right). They are denoted as:

- **Left-Hand Limit:** $$\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$$
- **Right-Hand Limit:** $$\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$$
If both one-sided limits exist and are equal, the two-sided limit exists.

### Infinite Limits

Infinite limits describe the behavior of a function as it approaches infinity or negative infinity. They are denoted as:
- $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty$$ (function approaches positive infinity)

- $$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = -\infty$$ (function approaches negative infinity)
