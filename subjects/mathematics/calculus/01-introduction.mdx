# Introduction to Calculus

Calculus is a fundamental branch of mathematics that explores how quantities change and accumulate. It provides powerful tools for analyzing motion, growth, and patterns in the world around us.

There are two main branches of calculus:

- **Differential Calculus:** Studies rates of change and the slopes of curves.
- **Integral Calculus:** Focuses on accumulation, areas under curves, and total change.

Calculus is essential in science, engineering, economics, and many other fields, helping us solve real-world problems and understand complex systems.
