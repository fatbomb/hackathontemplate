# The Problem of Finding the Area Under a Curve

The problem of finding the area under a curve is a fundamental question in mathematics, particularly in calculus. Before the development of calculus, mathematicians struggled to find the area under curves that were not simple geometric shapes. The central question was: **How do you calculate the area under a curve?**

In ancient times, mathematicians like Archimedes and Eudoxus used geometric methods to approximate areas under curves. They would inscribe polygons within the curve and calculate their areas, then refine their approximations by increasing the number of sides of the polygons. This method, known as the **method of exhaustion**, laid the groundwork for integral calculus.

In the 17th century, mathematicians like Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz developed the concept of the **integral**, which formalized the process of finding the area under a curve. They introduced the idea of dividing the area into infinitesimally small rectangles, calculating their areas, and summing them up to find the total area. This process is now known as **integration**.
The integral symbol ($\int$) was introduced to represent this summation process, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus established a connection between differentiation and integration.
