# Derivatives

The **derivative** of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x = a$ is defined as the limit:
$$
f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}
$$

This limit represents the **slope of the tangent line** to the graph of the function at the point $(a, f(a))$. The derivative measures how the function changes as its input changes, providing information about its rate of change.
