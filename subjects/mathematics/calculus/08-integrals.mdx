# Integrals

The integral is a fundamental concept in calculus that represents the accumulation of quantities, such as areas under curves or total distance traveled. It is the reverse process of differentiation and is used to find the total value of a function over an interval.

The integral of a function $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is denoted as:
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$
where:
- $a$ and $b$ are the limits of integration (the interval over which we are integrating)
- $f(x)$ is the function being integrated
- $dx$ indicates the variable of integration
- The result of the integral is a number that represents the total accumulation of the function $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, b]$.
